        <p>I started with unit testing about 4 years ago. I started writing what were
probably integration tests, when I was working on the database backend of our
application. The tests I wrote were designed to make sure that our process
which saved data actually saved data. Saving data involved creating a document,
calling save on it, which would save it in the filesystem-based database,
which would hit the filesystem. Testing it was saved correctly meant calling
open on a document, which hit the database, which hit the filesystem.</p>
<h1>I'm doing it wrong</h1>
<p>A bit later, I came across this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A test is not a unit test if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It talks to the database</li>
<li>It communicates across the network</li>
<li>It touches the file system</li>
<li>It can't run at the same time as any of your other unit tests</li>
<li>You have to do special things to your environment (such as editing config
  files) to run it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&mdash; <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=126923" title="Read Michael Feathers' Unit Testing Rules">Michael Feathers: A Set of Unit Testing Rules</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn't done all those things, but most of my tests did at least 2 of them<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the philosophical point of whether what I had written were unit
tests, there was a more fundamental problem: <strong>they were slow</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to set up the tests I had to create a database, and initialise its
schema. Then I had to repeatedly open and close the database, saving documents,
and checking they were saved correctly. At the end of the tests they had to
clear up the database.</p>
<h1>Impatience</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
laziness, impatience, and hubris.<br />
&mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall" title="The quote is from Programming Perl, by Larry Wall - go take a look at his Wikipedia profile">Larry Wall, Programming Perl</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Increasingly I was writing unit tests which I didn't bother to run during
development - they became another item on my check-list of things to do
before checking code in. If they failed, the specific thing I changed which
might have broken them might have been a while ago, making it hard to track
down.</p>
<p>So a while ago I tried a strange experiment. I tried to build an entire
website<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> without opening a browser. I didn't quite make it (eventually I had
to open a browser to check that it looked reasonable), but I got all the models
and views built by writing tests for them<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Using a <a href="http://www.dominicrodger.com/tdd-django-south.html" title="Read about a quick trick for making test runs in Django faster">quick trick</a>, my app's test suite runs in 2.1s on my
machine, which meant that it was pretty easy to run tests before each
commit<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Being able to specify <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/#running-tests" title="Django Documentation for running just a subset of your unit tests">particular tests</a> to
run makes test-driven development a practical possibility.</p>
<p>And each time I start a project this way, with a basic set of tests, I find
that I'm more likely to write tests next time I work on it. The tests I write
help me be confident that any changes I make are good, and confidence helps me
get stuff done, and getting stuff done makes me happy.</p>

<p>Since writing those first tests, I've started working on a team which
  works on database technology, so avoiding talking to the database is
  pretty tricky, since if you've not talked to the database, you've not
  tested your code.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
