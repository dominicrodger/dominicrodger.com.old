        <h1>The Project</h1>
<p>A good friend of mine alters cards for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> for fun
and profit. Previously, he posted them on his
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/JamesTMS" title="James' Twitter Feed">Twitter feed</a>, along with a brief description, but
that doesn't provide a great way of seeing at a glance the sort of
things he does - a place to point people who ask for examples of his
work.</p>
<p>Initially, I suggested <a href="http://www.flickr.com" title="Flickr: A photo-sharing site">Flickr</a>, but it didn't do quite what
he wanted. Since I had a few hours to spare, I did what any
self-respecting engineer would do, and offered to build something. I
launched the resulting site today:
<a href="http://www.griffinalters.com" title="Take a look at griffinalters.com - my first responsive site">griffinalters.com</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Since it was a fairly simple site, which basically has only one
interesting page, I thought now was as good a time as any to get
started down the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" title="Read Ethan Marcotte's seminal essay on Responsive Web Design, 2010">responsive design</a> path.</p>
<h1>Bootstrap First</h1>
<p><em>NB. You'll probably understand the rest of this article better if you
 take a look at <a href="http://www.griffinalters.com" title="Take a look at griffinalters.com - my first responsive site">griffinalters.com</a> first.</em></p>
<p>I started off by using the grid that Bootstrap gives you, along with
the extra responsive CSS file (<code>bootstrap-responsive.css</code>). The card
on the left-hand side was a <code>span4</code>, and the card thumbnails on the
right-hand side were each <code>span2</code>s. This worked - sort of. On large
enough screens (basically screens at least 768px wide), I'd get the
"featured" card on the left-hand side, and the list of thumbnails on
the right-hand side. The problem with this was that it was all or
nothing - above 768px it'd look like the full desktop site, belows
768px, it'd just be a single column - with a single thumbnail on each
row below the featured image.</p>
<h1>Hey, look! No span[0-9]!</h1>
<p>What I really wanted was the featured card on the left, and a set of
thumbnails on the right, which remained unless there was no space for
thumbnails at all. So, I started from scratch - here is how the
list of thumbnails worked<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;float: left; margin-right: 20px&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;card1-thumbnail.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This works more or less as intended<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> - the wider the viewport, the more
thumbnails there'll be on any given row.</p>
<p>To position the primary card, I floated it left, and wrapped the
thumbnails:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;width: 400px; float: left&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;card1-primary.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;margin-left: 420px&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;thumbnail&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;card1-thumbnail.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;thumbnail&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;card2-thumbnail.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    ...
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This works great for displays bigger than 420px, but the <code>margin-left</code>
means that if we can't fit any thumbnails to the right of the featured
card, then we end up having a blank space to the left of our
thumbnails.</p>
<p>To fix this, we scope the <code>margin-left</code> rule to "reasonably large"
displays. We give the wrapper around our thumbnails the class
"additional-cards", and then in our CSS file we write:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">@media</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">min-width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">420px</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nc">.additional-cards</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">margin-left</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">420px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This means that we only apply the left margin to our list of
thumbnails if our viewport is at least 420px<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This gets us a bit closer - but doesn't work great for displays only
slightly wider than 420px - we still end up with the margin to the
left of our list of thumbnails, but if there's not space to the right
of our featured image for at least one thumbnail, we're back to the
earlier problem, where the containing element for the list of
thumbnails gets pushed below our featured image, and has a blank space
to the left. This is easily fixed by adjusting our <code>min-width</code> to
768px, or something similar.</p>
<h1>min-height too!</h1>
<p>One slight irritation is that once you've got enough thumbnails, as
you scroll down, the featured image scrolls off the page, and the
thumbnails again have a large empty space to the left of them.</p>
<p>One way to fix this is with <code>position: fixed</code>, but this causes
problems for browsers which aren't tall enough to display the entire
featured image and its description - since they're not visible in the
browser's viewport at load time, and you can't scroll to seee it.</p>
<p>For this site, we know that all images are 350px high, so we probably
need a viewport about 600px high to see them:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">@media</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">min-height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">600px</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nc">.primary-card</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">fixed</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">float</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">none</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And that's almost it: there's a tiny bit more to our responsive
layout, but not a great deal - you can take a look at

<p>You'll have to excuse the somewhat basic theming of
  <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Twitter Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> - it uses a fairly unchanged version of

<li id="fn:3">
<p>The "less" is for the fact that I can't find a neat way to
  remove the right margin on the last element in each row. This
  means that the last thumbnail in each row can't get any closer
  than 20px from the right hand side of the containing element. I
  know it's possible to figure this out in JavaScript, but I'm not
  sure it's worth the effort.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
