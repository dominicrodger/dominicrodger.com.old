<p>See, I know nothing! &mdash; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0023128/quotes" title="Manuel, from Fawlty Towers">Manuel</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I distinctly remember being 17 years old, I'd just finished re-launching a
site for <a href="http://www.oxygen-online.org" title="Find out about Oxygen">a charity</a> I was involved with<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I confidently declared
that I knew all there was to know about building websites. And I believed it.</p>
<p>At the time, I was building sites in <a href="http://php.net/" title="Find out about PHP">PHP</a>, and like every other 17
year-old learning PHP, I'd built entirely my own system for managing the site.</p>
<p>I'd experimented with Flash. I knew some JavaScript, and was reasonably
proficient in PHP (a skill that has since been burned from my brain). As far as
I was concerned websites were just combinations of text, images and some degree
of interactivity, so I could do anything that was possible.</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous now, of course. I didn't know anything about caching,
didn't know a thing about HTTP, or load balancers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, or deploying properly
(apparently there's something wrong with copy-pasting files around to live
servers).</p>
<h2>Working alone</h2>
<p>Aside from a few years' more experience, one important thing has changed: <em>I no
longer work alone</em>.</p>
<p>Working alone meant I was always the smartest person in my team. My ideas were
always the best, and I was always the one to fix my mistakes. No one ever
disagreed with me, no one ever had a better idea, no one ever pointed out why
my idea was stupid.</p>
<p>All that changed when I finished university and started work - people pointed
me at ways of solving problems that were in categories I'd never even heard of.</p>
<p>I started participating in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/20972/dominic-rodger" title="View my profile on Stack Overflow, a Q&amp;A site for programmers">Stack Overflow</a>, and gave answers
to questions where I thought I could. Sometimes the answers I gave were good
enough, sometimes other people posted better answers, and I learned<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>All this is to say that I've learned how little I know by accidentally
surrounding myself with people who know better. If you think you're smart,
chances are you just haven't discovered all the things you don't know yet.</p>
<h2>Demonstrable Ignorance</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It's amazing how much you find you don't know when you try to explain
something in detail to someone else. It can start a whole new process of
discovery. &mdash; <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/10/podcast-71/#comment-40649" title="Jon Skeet's comment on a Stack Overflow podcast">Jon Skeet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few of the training sessions I run from time to time at work involve live
coding demonstrations. I open up Emacs, write some code, and then show it
running. Invariably someone will ask me what will happen if I change <em>a</em> to
<em>b</em>, and painfully frequently the answer is <em>"I'd never thought of doing that,
I've no idea"</em>. So I make the change, run it, and I try to piece together
what's going on with everyone watching. It's embarrassing, but maybe it's good
that I'm able to so quickly crush anyone's misperceptions that I know
everything about anything.</p>
