Title: About Me
Slug: about-me

I spend my days working in C++, and the odd evening working in Python.

Currently, my published open source projects are:

* [django-recurrence][django-recurrence]: a Django app that I've
  taken some responsibility for managing, though the code for
  django-recurrence was mostly written by others originally;
* [Kanisa][kanisa]: a Django app for managing Church websites;
* [django-board][django-board]: a reusable Django app for managing a
  page about an organisation's board members;
* [django-tinycontent][django-tinycontent]: a reusable Django app for
  managing tiny snippets of reusable content for Django templates;
* [djohno][djohno]: a reusable Django app for ensuring you've
  remembered to set up error logging and email correctly.


For fun, I build websites - currently I look after:

 * [This site][dominicrodger]: my personal blog, where I write about code;
 * [centralbaptistchelmsford.org][cbc]: my Church's website, and
   [trinitychurchbradford.org.uk][trinity], built with Kanisa;
 * [paulbeasleymurray.com][pbm]: the personal site of the previous
   minister of [Central Baptist Church, Chelmsford][cbc], containing
   resources for ministers, including sermon transcripts, articles
   and a blog;
 * [ministrytoday.org.uk][mt]: a journal for those in Christian leadership,
   built using my open-source projects [django-magazine][django-magazine] and
   [django-board][django-board];
 * [griffinalters.com][ga]: A portfolio site for another brother-in-law, this
   time focussing on alters to cards for Magic: The Gathering;
 * [talitha.org.uk][talitha]: A site for Talitha Arts, a non-profit
   groups of artists and art therapists working to restore hope,
   dignity and worth through the creative arts.

This blog is written with [Pelican][pelican].

The code (and all blog posts) are available on [GitHub][github-repo],
and the site is hosted by [Digital Ocean][digital-ocean].
