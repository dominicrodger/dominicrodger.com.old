Title: about me
Slug: about-me

I spend my days working in C++, and the odd evening working in Python.

For fun, I build websites - currently I look after:

 * [This site][dominicrodger]: my personal blog, where I write about code;
 * [centralbaptistchelmsford.org][cbc]: my Church's website, built with
   Kal&#233;o.
 * [A][connected]
   [few][trinity]
   [other][moorside]
   [sites][hadath], also built with Kal&#233;o.
 * [paulbeasleymurray.com][pbm]: my minister's personal site, containing
   resources for ministers, including sermon transcripts, articles and a blog.
 * [ministrytoday.org.uk][mt]: a journal for those in Christian leadership,
   built using my open-source projects [django-magazine][django-magazine] and
   [django-board][django-board].
 * [aarongriffin.co.uk][ajg]: A photography site for my brother-in-law.

This blog is written with [Pelican][pelican].

The code (and all blog posts) are available on [GitHub][github-repo],
and the site is hosted by [WebFaction][webfaction].
