Title: About Me
Slug: about-me

I spend my days working in C++, and the odd evening working in Python.

Currently, my published open source projects are:

* [django-board][django-board]: a reusable Django app for managing a
  page about an organisation's board members;
* [django-tinycontent][django-tinycontent]: a reusable Django app for
  managing tiny snippets of reusable content for Django templates.

For fun, I build websites - currently I look after:

 * [This site][dominicrodger]: my personal blog, where I write about code;
 * [centralbaptistchelmsford.org][cbc]: my Church's website, built with
   Kal&#233;o[^1].
 * [A][connected]
   [few][trinity]
   [other][moorside]
   [sites][hadath], also built with Kal&#233;o[^2];
 * [paulbeasleymurray.com][pbm]: my minister's personal site, containing
   resources for ministers, including sermon transcripts, articles and a blog;
 * [ministrytoday.org.uk][mt]: a journal for those in Christian leadership,
   built using my open-source projects [django-magazine][django-magazine] and
   [django-board][django-board];
 * [aarongriffin.co.uk][ajg]: A photography site for my brother-in-law;
 * [griffinalters.com][ga]: A portfolio site for another brother-in-law, this
   time focussing on alters to cards for Magic: The Gathering.

This blog is written with [Pelican][pelican].

The code (and all blog posts) are available on [GitHub][github-repo],
and the site is hosted by [Digital Ocean][digital-ocean].

# Kanisa

My current major project (as of June 2012) is [Kanisa][kanisa], a system for
managing Church websites. I've somewhat stalled on developing Kal&#233;o, for
2 reasons:

1. It was the first Django project I ever started, so there's a lot of built up
   technical debt.
2. It was my first attempt at a system for managing Church websites, so there's
   a lot of things I didn't anticipate that I now need, and a lot of things I
   thought I'd need that it turned out I didn't.

I am looking forward to the pain of the [Second-system effect][sse].

[^1]: Kal&#233;o is a Django application which I've written for
      managing websites for Churches. It is currently closed-source,
      and I'm hoping to replace it with Kanisa (despite what I said in
      [Starting Over](http://www.dominicrodger.com/starting-over.html)).
[^2]: These sites aren't directly run by me - I just look after the
      software and the servers.
