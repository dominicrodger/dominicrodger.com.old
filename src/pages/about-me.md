Title: About Me
Slug: about-me

I spend my days working in C++, and the odd evening working in Python.

Currently, my published open source projects are:

* [Kanisa][kanisa]: a Django app for managing Church websites;
* [django-board][django-board]: a reusable Django app for managing a
  page about an organisation's board members;
* [django-tinycontent][django-tinycontent]: a reusable Django app for
  managing tiny snippets of reusable content for Django templates;
* [djohno][djohno]: a reusable Django app for ensuring you've
  remembered to set up error logging and email correctly.


For fun, I build websites - currently I look after:

 * [This site][dominicrodger]: my personal blog, where I write about code;
 * [centralbaptistchelmsford.org][cbc]: my Church's website, built with
   Kanisa.
 * [A][connected]
   [few][trinity]
   [other][moorside]
   [sites][hadath], built with Kal&#233;o[^1] [^2];
 * [paulbeasleymurray.com][pbm]: my minister's personal site, containing
   resources for ministers, including sermon transcripts, articles and a blog;
 * [ministrytoday.org.uk][mt]: a journal for those in Christian leadership,
   built using my open-source projects [django-magazine][django-magazine] and
   [django-board][django-board];
 * [griffinalters.com][ga]: A portfolio site for another brother-in-law, this
   time focussing on alters to cards for Magic: The Gathering.

This blog is written with [Pelican][pelican].

The code (and all blog posts) are available on [GitHub][github-repo],
and the site is hosted by [Digital Ocean][digital-ocean].

# Kanisa

My current major project (as of April 2014) is [Kanisa][kanisa], a system for
managing Church websites. It's a replacement for Kal&#233;o, which
I've done for two reasons:

1. Kal&#233;o was the first Django project I ever started, so there's
   a lot of built up technical debt.
2. Kal&#233;o was my first attempt at a system for managing Church
   websites, so there's a lot of things I didn't anticipate that I
   now need, and a lot of things I thought I'd need that it turned
   out I didn't.

[^1]: Kal&#233;o is a Django application which I've written for
      managing websites for Churches. It's closed-source (mostly
      because the code is fairly embarrassing), and I'm replacing it
      with Kanisa (despite what I said in
      [Starting Over](http://www.dominicrodger.com/starting-over.html)).
[^2]: These sites aren't directly run by me - I just look after the
      software and the servers.
