Title: Moving to Ubuntu for mobile development
Slug: ubuntu-netbook

# My mobile office

My web-development office is a fast-moving place.

It averages around 50 miles per hour[^1], and I work on a laptop
normally squished between two people on the train to and from the
office.

When I happen to have a spare moment to build websites at home, I tend
to use my desktop, which is running Ubuntu. I do my editing in emacs,
where I've gradually got things set up more or less as I like them.

On my laptop that I've been using on the train, I'm working in
Notepad++, because I've never got around to installing emacs on
Windows.

# Hurrah for tiny laptops

I've recently (re-)acquired an Asus Aspire One. It's a pretty cheap
computer that I bought about 3 years ago. I gradually stopped using
it, as it tended to be too slow to do much with (it came with Windows
Vista, which may not have helped).

It's really quite a lot better as a portable laptop than the rather
heavy Dell I was using - mostly because it's light, it's narrower
(which is good for the fairly small seats on the train), and its
battery lasts for approximately a millenium.

Having got used to (and grown rather fond of) Ubuntu on my desktop, I
thought it was worth a go trying it on my Aspire One. It's taken me
several hours (most of which was spent watching progress bars and a
[tragically inevitable Wimbledon final][wimbledon-2012]), so I thought
I'd write up how I got it working, partly in case I ever need to do it
again.

# Pain

First, I tried downloading the latest release of Ubuntu (12.04),
dumping it on a USB stick, and booting from that. I quickly got into
Ubuntu, only to get an `io-remap` error, at which point the bottom of
the screen to go black, and the top half of the screen tried to
display both halves simultaneously. I went through the installation
process anyway[^2], hoping the problem would go away. It didn't.

Next, I thought I'd try Linux Mint. Same thing, no dice.

Next, I did some reading, and discovered that I'd bumped into a known
issue, which may or may not be fixed in the latest pre-release of
Ubuntu (12.10). I downloaded that. Also no dice.

Next, I read some workarounds for Ubuntu 12.04, so I re-installed and
tried those. Still no dice.

I tried Linux Mint again, tweaking some display options. Still no luck.

Then, I tried Ubuntu 12.04 again, and discovered that if I hit quit
when asked whether I wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04, the screen would
redraw, and everything looked fine. I installed, went to restart, and
was presented with a pitch black screen.

I discovered then that Ctrl-Alt-F1 got me a terminal[^3], but that
wasn't going to help me build websites. I installed some things just
for fun.

Googling around brought me to [this answer][ask-ubuntu], which told me
to type the magic incantation at the prompt:

    sudo service lightdm restart

A [blog post][help-at-hand] linked from that answer told me to edit
`/etc/default/grub` and add this line (in place of the previous
setting of `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`):

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet console=tty1 acpi_backlight=vendor\
    acpi_osi=Linux acer_wmi.blacklist=yes mem=1920mb"

Once I'd done that, it all worked.

Not for the first time, I had a feeling that I didn't really know what
I was doing (though I am of course very happy to be using my vendor's
acpi_backlight, I hope he doesn't mind).

Admittedly my laptop's a little old (I think it came out three
years ago or so), but that was a serious amount of pain just to get
things working. Now I've got things working, it's great, but I can't
help wondering how many people would have been sufficiently stubborn
to get this far. I had a similarly painful experience upgrading my
Desktop from Ubuntu 11 to Ubuntu 12, so maybe I've just got really,
really bad luck.

# Good Things

All this means that the editing environment I use on my laptop is now
identical to the one I use on my desktop. I've synced my emacs
configurations with Dropbox, and logged in to Google Chrome so my
bookmarks are synced. I now get to work in a development environment
where I can use [virtualenvwrapper][virtualenvwrapper] and where most
things are pip-installable. Even better, I didn't have to spend a load
of money on a Macbook Air, and I get to retain my free-software
smugness.

[^1]: As far as speed goes at least. Its average velocity, my A-level
      physics teacher would probably wish me to point out, is roughly
      0 miles per hour.

[^2]: The top half of the screen would redraw to display whatever your
      mouse was on, which made progress a challenge, but not impossible.

[^3]: A couple of people seemed surprised that I didn't know that - I
      guess it's the sort of thing you learn once and then just
      assume.
