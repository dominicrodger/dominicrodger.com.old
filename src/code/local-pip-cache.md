Title: Using a local cache for pip packages
Slug: local-pip-cache

I do a lot of development without an internet connection[^1], so being
able to install packages into a virtual environment without a
connection to PyPI is pretty useful.

I've got a couple of aliases in my `.bashrc` which help with this[^2]:

    ::bash
    alias pipcache='pip install --download ${HOME}/.pip-packages'
    alias pipinstall='pip install --no-index --find-links=file://${HOME}/.pip-packages/'

The first downloads the packages to my local cache, the second
installs them from the cache.

Usage is probably fairly obvious:

    ::bash
    pipcache Django==1.5 # Put Django-1.5.tar.gz in ~/.pip-packages
    pipinstall Django==1.5 # Install ~/.pip-packages/Django-1.5.tar.gz

    pipcache -r requirements.txt # Cache all the requirements of a project
    pipinstall -r requirements.txt # Install all requirements from the cache

It's perfectly possible to cache multiple versions of the same
package[^3], which is useful for being able to test upgrading to newer
releases, whilst still being able to revert to the previously pinned
package if you find nothing works.

Since I mostly use a fairly small set of packages, this means I can
start up a brand new virtualenv and I'm very likely to have everything
I need without going to PyPI. Not having to download large packages
makes installs quicker too[^4].

[^3]: At the time of writing I have three versions of Django locally.
[^4]: Django 1.5 weighs in at around 8MB, and downloading it is
      sometimes surprisingly slow.
