Title: Travis, You Are Awesome
Slug: build-breaking

I came across [Travis CI][travis-ci] this week, and it's awesome.

I've got a bunch of tests for [django-magazine][django-magazine], but
I'm not very good at running them. It turns out that unit tests aren't
very useful if you don't run them, so I wanted to make sure that every
time I pushed code to it, the tests run. Enter Travis CI.

## Easy Unit Testing for Reusable Apps

django-magazine is a reusable app - that is, it doesn't ship with
settings files, so you can't run its tests just after installing
it[^1].

I wasn't sure what the easiest way to handle this was, so I looked
around for Django reusable apps that were already using Travis, and
stumbled across [django-forms-builder][django-forms-builder]. They'd
solved this by adding an `example_project` folder, which had a simple
settings file, a urls file and a `manage.py`[^2].

That allows me to run the tests without any extra set-up, though I
still haven't worked out how to allow people who've just installed
from pip[^3] to run the tests right out of the box.

## .travis.yml

There are just two things you need to do to get Travis CI working for
your project.

Firstly - sign in on their website. There's a slightly scary message
about giving it write access to your repositories, but there's a
decent enough reason on the Travis site explaining why they need
it[^4].

Secondly - add a .travis.yml file to your root directory, commit, and
push to GitHub. Travis CI will pick up your change, and start
building. [My file][my-travis-yml] currently looks like this:

    ::yaml
    language: python
    python:
      - "2.6"
      - "2.7"
    env:
      - DJANGO=1.3.1
      - DJANGO=1.4
    install:
      - pip install -q Django==$DJANGO --use-mirrors
      - pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
      - pip install pep8
    script:
      - pep8 --exclude=migrations magazine
      - ./magazine/example_project/manage.py test magazine

This will kick off four builds:

1. Python 2.6 and Django 1.3.1;
2. Python 2.6 and Django 1.4;
3. Python 2.7 and Django 1.3.1;
4. Python 2.7 and Django 1.4.

Each of those will run in parallel, and you'll then get an e-mail with
the status of your build, if it changed (pleasingly, it doesn't e-mail
you for every build - open if the status of it has switched between
fixed and broken).

The `--use-mirrors` stuff is an attempt to help Travis CI avoid
overloading PyPI.

## Bonus Points: PEP-8

I've recently discovered PEP-8, which I half knew about, but I'd never
attempted to make my code meet it. Then [someone forked][fork]
django-magazine to make it meet PEP-8, and I was shamed into fixing
it. I've added a line to my `.travis.yml` file so the build fails if
checked-in code is not PEP-8 friendly.

## Advertise Your Status

Travis CI even provides an image that'll show your current build
status - adding it to my `README.md` file allows me to advertise that
(and implicitly, that I'm a bit obsessive) using:

    https://secure.travis-ci.org/dominicrodger/django-magazine.png?branch=master

Currently, that looks like: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dominicrodger/django-magazine.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dominicrodger/django-magazine)

All this is to say, Travis CI is awesome, and you should use it.

[^1]: This is probably a good time to point out that django-magazine
      is not available on PyPI yet. I've never added anything to PyPI
      before, and there's a couple of things I'd like to sort out
      before doing that.  Firstly I'd like to make sure I've tagged
      things properly, and secondly I need to factor out the book
      review stuff which is currently not tested, and is very specific
      to my particular use case.

[^2]: They all had a `templates` folder, with a base template, which
      django-magazine doesn't need. That might be because I've done
      something wrong (every template extends
      `magazine/magazine_base.html`, which doesn't have much in the
      way of HTML, but enough that all the tests pass, one of these
      days I should probably give it some simple styles).

[^3]: As opposed to `git clone`, which is what Travis CI does, which
      means that the `example_project` code is in a predictable
      location (also, I've not yet added `example_project` to my
      manifest file, so it's not installed by pip).

[^4]: I'd love there to be a workaround for this, but Travis is
      awesome enough that I mostly just don't care.
