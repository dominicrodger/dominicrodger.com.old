Title: Using code coverage to find bugs
Slug: coverage

Yesterday, I found two bugs whilst looking at a code coverage
report.

I tend to think that shooting for 100% code coverage adds unnecessary
overheard - often the last few percent doesn't give you much benefit,
and takes a disproportionate amount of time to reach, but it's useful
to at least understand why particular lines of code aren't hit by your
tests. Perhaps those lines are dead code, or perhaps - as was the case
for me yesterday - it's because your code is broken.

# Bug #1 - overriding the wrong method

The first bug I found yesterday was in my feed generation code for
[tinyblog][tinyblog]. Because of the way feed generation works in
Django (see the [docs][feeddocs] if you're interested), provided you
have a single test that hits your feed URL, you'll probably have
covered 100% of your feed generation code[^1]. Strangely, my coverage
report showed my tests were failing to hit one method - `copyright`.

Taking a quick look at the base class for my RSS feed class, I spotted
that it contained no reference to a method named `copyright`, though
it did reference a method named `feed_copyright`. Renaming the method
and re-running my tests showed that I now hit the previously missing
lines of code (and more importantly, my feed now contained the
copyright information I'd always intended to be there).

Presumably, that name's always been wrong - having fixed up the name I
also discovered a glaringly obvious bug in my implementation of
`feed_copyright` which meant it would always raise an exception. I can
only assume I copy-pasted from a broken example of how to do feeds in
Django, without checking whether it worked[^2].

# Bug #2 - a broken import

More strangely, I was missing a whole chunk of one file[^3]. Turned
out that one of my templatetags files had a bad import, which Django
silenced, since `TEMPLATE_DEBUG` was set to `False`[^4]. This bad
import would have meant my template tags just didn't work. Fixing up
the bad import raised the coverage of the module with the broken
import to 100%, which was encouraging, though yet another sign that
100% coverage is not sufficient (I'd clearly not been checking the
output of any of those template tags, or other tests would have
failed).

# Self-evident conclusions

Aiming for 100% code coverage might not be that useful - it doesn't
tell you anything about whether your code works, and is probably more
effort than it's worth on a project rather more serious than my tiny
blogging application.

*However*, I do think it is worth at least understanding *why* your
code coverage isn't 100% - take a look at the lines you're missing and ask yourself these questions:

1. Would you expect your tests to hit this code?
2. What would it take to make sure your tests do hit this code?
3. Is it worth the effort?

[^1]: This shows fairly obviously the problem with 100% coverage -
      just by executing a `GET` request on my feed URL I've hit 100%
      coverage, even though I've no idea if the code's correct. All I
      know is that running the code doesn't cause an exception to be
      raised, which is valuable, but hardly sufficien to show my
      code's working correctly.
[^2]: I wish I could tell you this didn't sound like me, but never
      mind.
[^3]: Normally coverage reports in `coverage.py` don't include blank
      lines.
[^4]: The lesson here is to make sure that `DEBUG` and
      `TEMPLATE_DEBUG` are set to `True` in unit tests - the tests
      fail loudly if I set those two settings in my
      `test_settings.py`, and show me exactly where the problem is.
