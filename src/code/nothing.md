Title: I Know Nothing
Slug: nothing

> See, I know nothing! &mdash; [Manuel][manuel]

I distinctly remember being 17 years old, I'd just finished re-launching a
site for [a charity][oxygen] I was involved with[^1], and I confidently declared
that I knew all there was to know about building websites. And I believed it.

At the time, I was building sites in [PHP][php], and like every other 17
year-old learning PHP, I'd built entirely my own system for managing the site.

I'd experimented with Flash. I knew some JavaScript, and was reasonably
proficient in PHP (a skill that has since been burned from my brain). As far as
I was concerned websites were just combinations of text, images and some degree
of interactivity, so I could do anything that was possible.

It seems ridiculous now, of course. I didn't know anything about caching,
didn't know a thing about HTTP, or load balancers[^2], or deploying properly
(apparently there's something wrong with copy-pasting files around to live
servers).

## Working alone

Aside from a few years' more experience, one important thing has changed: *I no
longer work alone*.

Working alone meant I was always the smartest person in my team. My ideas were
always the best, and I was always the one to fix my mistakes. No one ever
disagreed with me, no one ever had a better idea, no one ever pointed out why
my idea was stupid.

All that changed when I finished university and started work - people pointed
me at ways of solving problems that were in categories I'd never even heard of.

I started participating in [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow], and gave answers
to questions where I thought I could. Sometimes the answers I gave were good
enough, sometimes other people posted better answers, and I learned[^3].

All this is to say that I've learned how little I know by accidentally
surrounding myself with me who know better. If you think you're smart, chances
are you just haven't discovered all the things you don't know yet.

## Demonstrable Ignorance

A few of the training sessions I run from time to time at work involve live
coding demonstrations. I open up Emacs, write some code, and then show it
running. Invariably someone will ask me what will happen if I change *a* to
*b*, and painfully frequently the answer is *"I'd never thought of doing that,
I've no idea"*. So I make the change, run it, and I try to piece together
what's going on with everyone watching. It's embarrassing, but maybe it's good
that I'm able to so quickly crush anyone's misperceptions that I know
everything about anything.

[^1]: [Oxygen's site][oxygen] has gone through several versions since I moved
      away in 2004 to start university. The wonderful Wayback Machine has
      a [cache of the site][oxygen-historical] from around that time.
[^2]: I still don't (since none of [my various sites][about-me] get significant
      amounts of traffic), but hey, at least I know the categories of things
      which I know nothing about.
[^3]: [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] was also a pretty good way to get better
      at writing, as [others have said][coding-horror-writing].
